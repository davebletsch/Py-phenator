# Py-phenator

This was my first attempt to automate a rather mundane but necessary task. Py-phenator uses a very simple Python script to replace spaces in-between words with hyphens.

Often I would find myself realizing a compound phrase would be better suited as hyphenated. The perfectionist in me simply couldn't let this go, not matter how casual the form of electronic communication. As a result, I would either manually click onto each space, backspace to the first space, or just delete the phrase entirely and start over. All of these options are far more time-consuming and click-intensive than I'd like. So, I implemented this [script](https://github.com/davebletsch/Py-phenator/blob/master/pyphenator) via MacOS Automator.

## Automator Procedure
(coming soon)

## To Use:
1. Highlight the text phrase to be hyphenated. ![Highlight](https://github.com/davebletsch/Py-phenator/blob/master/images/1-Highlight%20and%20Copy.png)
2. Copy to the clipboard (CMD + c).
3. Right click. ![Right click](https://github.com/davebletsch/Py-phenator/blob/master/images/2-Right%20Click.png)
4. Select Pyphenator from the quick service context menu. ![Select Pyphenator](https://github.com/davebletsch/Py-phenator/blob/master/images/3-Select%20Pyphenator.png)
4. Paste the newly-hyphenated compound phrase over the hightlighted text (CMD + v). ![Paste](https://github.com/davebletsch/Py-phenator/blob/master/images/4-Paste%20results.png)
